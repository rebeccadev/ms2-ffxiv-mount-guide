# FFXIV Mount Guide

FFXIV is one of the most popular video games to date within the MMORPG genre. The purpose of the website is to provide information of mounts within the game to both
new and existing players, similar to a Pokedex in popular RPG Pokemon. The website will build upon existing skills within HTML and CSS and utilize new skills within Javascript, 
JQuery and the use of an API.

Wireframes have been created using a mobile first approach. 
Please [click here](assets/ms2wireframes.pdf) to view the PDF showing full wireframes for the site. 

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Playstation website and website for popular mmo Guild Wars 2. 
I liked how clean the websites look, and how they utilize different coloured backgrounds for different sections. 


**Colours**

White space has been used to provide a sense of calm,

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white and cream background. 
and have used (#000000) for my text within the footer section to stand out against the black background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Crimson Text has been used for headings - this font works well against the sans serif body text and provides an old school fantasy feel. 

**Body text**

Work sans has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user and contrasts nicely against the heading font.

**Mount Guide text**
Within the Mount Guide I have used the font VT323 - I used this font as it is reminiscent of old 8-bit style video games and thought
it fitted well within the mount guide. 

**Imagery**

I have used images from the Final Fantasy franchise within the website. Alot of the images have been obtained from the website
clean PNG. I wanted to use illustrated images to fit in with the fantasy theme. 

For the gallery I have used screenshots from the video game itself, so users can see what these mounts look like whilst in game.

#Code 


- [Build a Pokédex REPLICA with Vanilla JavaScript and the PokéAPI Justin Kim] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjSaZb67n8) This tutorial
has helped me with building my app and understanding the use of APIS. I have edited the CSS of the pokedex for my design. In terms
of code I have used the tutorial to produce fetch requests and manipulate the dom. It has been such a valuable resource. The tutorial
uses the Poke API, however since I have used the FFXIV collect API I have had to make my own paging system within javascript.

Inspiration has been taken from the following websites


- [Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/)

![Playstation preview](assets/images/READMEimages/pspreview.png)

I really liked the use of multiple background colours for sections within the playstation website. I feel this
helps to organise different content well. 


- [Guild Wars 2](https://welcome.guildwars2.com/) 

![Guild Wars preview](assets/images/READMEimages/gw2preview.png)

I really liked the use of whitespace within the Guild Wars 2 website. I also liked the contrast between the header
and body text.
