# FFXIV Mount Guide

FFXIV is one of the most popular video games to date within the MMORPG genre. The purpose of the website is to provide information of mounts within the game to both
new and existing players, similar to a Pokedex in popular RPG Pokemon. The website will build upon existing skills within HTML and CSS and utilize new skills within Javascript, 
JQuery and the use of an API.

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Playstation website and website for popular mmo Guild Wars 2. 
I liked how clean the websites look, and how they utilize different coloured backgrounds for different sections. 


**Colours**

White space has been used to provide a sense of calm, I have also utilised a golden sand colour (#fafafa) within the logo and footer. 
This has been used to tie in with the sand in the arena of the riding school and also provides an upmarket feel to the site and brand. 

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white background. 
and have used (#000000) for my text within the footer section to stand out against the black background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Crimson Text has been used for headings - this font works well against the sans serif body text and provides an old school fantasy feel. 

**Body text**

Work sans has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user and contrasts nicely against the heading and navigation font of Lora.

**Imagery**

I have used images from the Final Fantasy franchise within the website. Alot of the images have been obtained from the website
clean PNG. I wanted to use illustrated images to fit in with the fantasy theme.
