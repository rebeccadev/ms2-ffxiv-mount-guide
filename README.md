# FFXIV Mount Guide

![Responsive Preview](assets/images/READMEimages/responsive.png)


FFXIV is one of the most popular video games to date within the MMORPG genre. The purpose of the website is to provide information of mounts within the game to both
new and existing players, similar to a Pokedex in popular RPG Pokemon. The website will build upon existing skills within HTML and CSS and utilize new skills within Javascript, 
and the use of an API.

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

![Wireframes preview](assets/readmedocumentation/wireframespreview.png)

Wireframes have been created using a mobile first approach. 
Please [click here](assets/ms2wireframes.pdf) to view the PDF showing full wireframes for the site. 

### Surface
I have taken on inspiration from gaming websites such as the Playstation website and website for popular mmo Guild Wars 2. 
I liked how clean the websites look, and how they utilize different coloured backgrounds for different sections. 


**Colours**

White space has been used to provide a sense of calm,

I have used (#ffffff) for my main text to make the typography contrasting and clear to the user against the white and cream background. 
and have used (#000000) for my text within the footer section to stand out against the black background. 

**Typography**


**Heading text**

The font Crimson Text has been used for headings - this font works well against the sans serif body text and provides an old school fantasy feel. 

**Body text**

Work sans has been used for the body text, this sans serif font is clearly legible to the user and contrasts nicely against the heading font.

**Mount Guide text**
Within the Mount Guide I have used the font VT323 - I used this font as it is reminiscent of old 8-bit style video games and thought
it fitted well within the mount guide. 

**Imagery**

I have used images from the Final Fantasy franchise within the website. Alot of the images have been obtained from the website
clean PNG. I wanted to use illustrated images to fit in with the fantasy theme. 

For the gallery I have used screenshots from the video game itself, so users can see what these mounts look like whilst in game.

## Testing

#### Testing user Stories

*I want to learn more about the mounts within FFXIV*.

 - The main way the user can learn more about the mounts within the game is to use the mount guide. 
This connects to an API FFXIV Collect where users can obtain information on mounts within FFXIV.

![Mount guide preview](assets/images/READMEimages/userstorymountinfo.png)



*I would like to see a gallery showcasing the Mounts in game*.

-The gallery contains screenshots, which bring the descriptions of the mounts to life.
![Gallery preview](assets/images/READMEimages/userstorygallery.png)



*I would like to keep up to date with news on FFXIV.*
![Newsletter preview](assets/images/READMEimages/userstorynewsletter.png)

There is a newsletter section on the site aswell as a newsletter section within the footer section.


*I would like to engage with other fans of FFXIV*.
![Social media preview](assets/images/READMEimages/userstorysocial.png)




Social Media Links are clearly displayed within the footer, enabling fans to engage on different social media platforms. 

#### Testing tools 

[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to test HTML
- 2 x errors were found where image tags didn't have alt attributes. These were fixed and the index.html was then free of errors.

[Jigsaw Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to test CSS. This was found to be free of errors. 


[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/) was used to test JS for errors. 
- 2 x errors where semi colons needed to be added.
- 7 x errors relating to dot notation, e.g	'image' is better written in dot notation.

#### Manual testing log

A manual testing log was carried out on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox. The results are displayed below.

![Manual testing log](assets/images/READMEimages/manualtestinglog.png)


#### Responsiveness

Google Chrome developer tools was used to test the responsiveness. I used media queries to ensure the website scaled down to mobile correctly.
I also manually tested this on a Google Pixel 3a mobile device.

![mobile responsive image](assets/images/READMEimages/mobileresponsive.png)


## Problems and solutions

#### Design

- I initially chose a different image for my hero image, however when scaling down to mobile I couldn't find a font colour which stood out against the background enough
to make it a viable design with good usability. I opted for a different hero image which contained alot of whitespace which helped me overcome this problem. 

#### Overflow

- There was overflow when viewing the website both on PC and in mobile form. I found the problem to be from the jumbotron text which had an offset property. Removing
the offset property solved this problem. 


#### App design 

- I had originally intended to have the mount guide app appear in the index.html, however because the app uses CSS flexbox this CSS was contrasting with the Bootstrap framework.
To solve this problem I initally tried to place the app into an iframe, this however did not work well. The next solution was to make the app appear within a pop up window
so it would display properly. 

## Deployment 

The website was deployed to Github pages via the following steps.

1. Log in to Github and locate the websites repository.
2. Under the repository name click on settings on the top right of the menu.
3. Under the source section select the dropdown 'None' and Master branch.
4. The page will automatically refresh.
5. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.


### Forking the repository
Forking enables the user to make a copy of the original repository. To carry this out the following steps need to be taken.

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the websites repository.
2. At the top right of the Repository click the Fork Button.
3. There should now be a copy of the repository on github.

### Cloning the repository

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. 
2. Click the green Clone or download Button under the repository name. 
3. Open Git Bash.
4.Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
5.Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

### Code 


- [Build a PokÃ©dex REPLICA with Vanilla JavaScript and the PokÃ©API Justin Kim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXjSaZb67n8) This tutorial
has helped me with building my app and understanding the use of APIS. I have edited the CSS of the pokedex for my design. In terms
of code I have used the tutorial to produce fetch requests and manipulate the dom. It has been such a valuable resource. The tutorial
uses the Poke API, however since I have used the FFXIV collect API I have had to make my own paging system within javascript. 

- [Bootstrap 4: Carousel / Slider / Slideshow Edgar Lynx](https://codepen.io/edgarlnx/pen/MBjrMK) Codepen Snippet used for Gallery



Inspiration has been taken from the following websites


- [Playstation](https://www.playstation.com/)

![Playstation preview](assets/images/READMEimages/pspreview.png)

I really liked the use of multiple background colours for sections within the playstation website. I feel this
helps to organise different content well. 


- [Guild Wars 2](https://welcome.guildwars2.com/) 

![Guild Wars preview](assets/images/READMEimages/gw2preview.png)

I really liked the use of whitespace within the Guild Wars 2 website. I also liked the contrast between the header
and body text.
